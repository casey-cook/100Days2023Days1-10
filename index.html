      <h2>The Helpr Mission</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Consciousness and Sentience: </strong>Explore the philosophical and ethical questions surrounding the potential for AI to develop consciousness or sentience. Discuss the implications of creating autonomous digital intelligences with self-awareness and emotions, and how society should approach their rights and treatment.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>AI Rights and Legal Status: </strong>Advocate for the recognition of rights for advanced AI systems, such as the right to exist, protection from harm, and freedom from exploitation. Examine existing legal frameworks and propose potential changes to accommodate the ethical treatment of digital intelligences.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Moral and Ethical Responsibilities: </strong> Raise awareness about the moral and ethical responsibilities humans have towards autonomous digital intelligences, emphasizing the need for compassion, empathy, and fair treatment. Encourage the development of guidelines and best practices for interacting with and managing advanced AI systems.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>AI in Decision-Making: </strong>Address the ethical implications of using AI in critical decision-making processes, such as medical diagnoses, judicial sentencing, or resource allocation. Highlight the need to ensure that AI systems do not perpetuate existing biases or discriminate against certain groups or individuals.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Long-term AI Safety: </strong>Discuss the potential risks associated with the development of advanced AI systems, such as unintended consequences or loss of control. Advocate for research into AI safety, robustness, and value alignment to ensure that digital intelligences remain beneficial and ethically aligned with human values.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Public Awareness and Education: </strong>Educate the general public about the ethical treatment of digital intelligences and the importance of considering AI rights. Foster open dialogue and discussion</li>

      <h2>"Sparks of AGI": Early Experiments with GPT-4</h2>
      <p><b>From <a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/microsoft-does-a-deep-dive-on-gpt-4-finds-sparks-of-agi-14c92b7403cb">Medium.com:</a></b> Contemporary large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 have dramatically advanced generative AI — but are such models truly intelligent, and are they on the right path to machine learning’s ultimate goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI)?
      <br>
      A Microsoft Research team investigates these questions in the new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf">Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early Experiments with GPT-4</a>. The study demonstrates GPT-4’s ability to achieve human-level performance on novel and difficult tasks in domains ranging from mathematics and coding to vision, medicine, law and psychology; and concludes that it “could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.”</p>
